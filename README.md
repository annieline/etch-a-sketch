# etch-a-sketch
etch-a-sketch is a simple app that mimics the classic childhood toy using HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The main functionality of this app is to change the colour of the grid cells on mouse hover. I implemented some features that will help the user make a better picture such as:

Grid size slider: user can choose a new dimensions for their grid (keeping the container intact) using a slider.
Color picker: user can pick a new color from the color picker to use in their drawing.
Random button: a random pop of fun! 
Clear button: clears the canvas for the user to reset their drawing on the same canvas.

I learned more about DOM manipulation, flexbox and implementing different CSS features from this project. I also was able to focus on building requirements for myself and following logic to implement solutions.

For features I can implement in the future:
Gradation button: everytime a user hovers over the cell it gets 10% darker.
Eraser button: erases the coloured pixel on hover.
